# Performance Analysis of Type-1 and Type-2 Hypervisors

## Proxmox VE vs VMware Workstation

This project demonstrates the creation, configuration, and performance analysis of virtual machines using two different types of hypervisors:

* **Type-1 Hypervisor:** Proxmox VE
* **Type-2 Hypervisor:** VMware Workstation

Both virtual machines use Ubuntu as the guest operating system and are configured with similar hardware resources. CPU performance is measured using **Sysbench** and the obtained results are recorded for comparison.

---

3. To create a virtual machine using VMware Workstation.
4. To configure both virtual machines with similar hardware resources.
5. To install Ubuntu on both virtual machines.
6. To verify CPU, memory, and disk configurations.
7. To install Sysbench.
8. To perform CPU benchmarking.
9. To record execution time, events per second, and latency.
10. To compare the performance of both virtualization environments.

# Common Virtual Machine Configuration

Both virtual machines are configured with approximately the same resources.

| Resource               | Configuration |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Guest Operating System | Ubuntu        |
| CPU                    | 2 vCPU        |

# Understanding the Performance Metrics

## Total Execution Time

Total time required by Sysbench to complete the CPU benchmark.

A lower execution time means the benchmark completed in less time.

## Total Events

The total number of benchmark operations performed during the test.

## Events Per Second

The number of benchmark operations completed per second.

A higher events-per-second value indicates higher benchmark throughput.

## Latency

Latency represents the time required to complete an individual operation.

The benchmark provides:

* Minimum latency

# Final Comparison

The experiment creates two Ubuntu virtual machines using different hypervisor types.

### Type-1

```text
Physical Server
      ↓
Proxmox VE
      ↓
Ubuntu VM
      ↓
2 vCPU + 2 GB RAM + 20 GB Disk
      ↓
Sysbench CPU Benchmark
```

### Type-2

```text
Host Operating System
      ↓
VMware Workstation
      ↓
Ubuntu VM
      ↓
2 vCPU + 2 GB RAM + 20 GB Disk
      ↓
Sysbench CPU Benchmark
```

The same Sysbench CPU benchmark is executed in both environments. The obtained execution time, events per second, and latency values are used for the performance comparison.

The final observations should be based on the actual benchmark results obtained from the two systems.

---

# Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the practical implementation and performance analysis of Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisors.

Proxmox VE is used as the Type-1 hypervisor, while VMware Workstation is used as the Type-2 hypervisor. Ubuntu is installed as the guest operating system in both environments.

Both virtual machines are configured with approximately:

* 2 vCPU
* 2 GB RAM
* 20 GB disk

System configuration is verified using Linux commands such as `hostnamectl`, `lscpu`, `free -h`, and `df -h`.

Sysbench is then installed and used to perform CPU benchmarking. The benchmark results provide measurements such as total execution time, total events, events per second, and latency.

These measured values can then be used to analyze the performance of the two virtualization environments under similar virtual machine configurations.
